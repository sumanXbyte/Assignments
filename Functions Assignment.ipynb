    "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
    "-> A function is a block of reusable code that is defined independently using the def keyword and can be called directly by its name. It is not associated with any object or class.\n",
    "A method is a function that is associated with an object or class. It is defined inside a class and is called using the dot notation on an object or class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
    "-> Parameters are the variables listed in the function definition. They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function.\n",
    "Arguments are the actual values that are passed to the function when it is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
    "-> Ways to Define a Function:\n",
    "Regular function definition using def\n",
    "Lambda functions (anonymous functions)\n",
    "Functions with default parameters\n",
    "Functions with variable-length arguments\n",
    "Nested functions (functions inside functions)\n",
    "Decorator functions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the purpose of the return statement in a Python function?\n",
    "-> The return statement is used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exit a function and go back to where it was called\n",
    "Send back a value (or multiple values) to the caller\n",
    "End function execution - any code after return is not executed\n",
    "\n",
    "If no return statement is used, the function returns None by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
    "-> An iterable is any Python object that can return its elements one at a time. Think of it as a container that holds items.\n",
    "An iterator is an object that actually performs the iteration. It remembers where it is in the sequence and knows how to get the next item. \n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
    "-> A generator is a special type of iterator that is defined using a function with the yield keyword instead of return. Generators provide an elegant way to create iterators without having to write a class with __iter__() and __next__() methods.\n",
    "Generators are defined in two ways: using generator functions with yield, or using generator expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
    "-> Generators offer several significant advantages over regular functions that return complete data structures like lists. The primary benefits revolve around memory efficiency, lazy evaluation, and the ability to represent infinite sequences.\n",
    "Memory Efficiency: Regular functions that return lists must create the entire list in memory before returning it.\n",
    "Lazy Evaluation: Generators compute values only when requested, not all at once. This means if you only need the first few items from a potentially large sequence, the generator won't waste time computing values you'll never use. \n",
    "Infinite Sequences: Generators can represent infinite sequences because they don't need to store all values in memory.\n",
    "Pipeline Processing: Generators can be chained together to create data processing pipelines where each stage processes items one at a time, passing results to the next stage without storing intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
    "-> A lambda function is a small anonymous function that is defined without a name using the lambda keyword. The term \"anonymous\" means it doesn't require a formal function definition with def.\n",
    "Lambda functions are typically used in situations where you need a simple function for a short period, especially when passing functions as arguments to higher-order functions like map(), filter(), sorted(), and reduce(). They make code more concise when the function logic is simple enough to fit in one line.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python.\n",
    "-> The map() function is a built-in Python function that applies a given function to every item in an iterable, such as a list, tuple, or string, and returns a map object which is an iterator containing the results. Think of it as a way to transform each element in a collection using the same operation without writing explicit loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the difference between map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python?\n",
    "-> The map() function transforms each element in an iterable by applying a function to it. It takes every single item, processes it through your function, and produces a new collection with the same number of elements but potentially different values.\n",
    "The filter() function selects elements from an iterable based on a condition. It applies a function that returns True or False to each element, keeping only those elements where the function returns True. \n",
    "The reduce() function, which must be imported from the functools module, takes an iterable and reduces it down to a single accumulated value.\n",
    "\n",
    "11.  Using pen & paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using reduce function on this given list: [47, 11, 42, 13]\n",
    "-> from functools import reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "# The list we're working with\n",
    "numbers = [47, 11, 42, 13]\n",
    "\n",
    "# The reduce function call\n",
    "result = reduce(lambda acc, x: acc + x, numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1 (First Reduction):\n",
    "\n",
    "Accumulator (acc) = 47 (first element)\n",
    "Current element (x) = 11 (second element)\n",
    "Operation: acc + x = 47 + 11 = 58\n",
    "New accumulator value = 58\n",
    "Remaining list: [42, 13]\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2 (Second Reduction):\n",
    "\n",
    "Accumulator (acc) = 58 (result from previous step)\n",
    "Current element (x) = 42 (third element)\n",
    "Operation: acc + x = 58 + 42 = 100\n",
